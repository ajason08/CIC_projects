       "'NK cells have two main functions , namely cell-mediated cytotoxicity and production of cytokines . Multiple inhibitory receptors that regulate NK-cell cytotoxicity have been characterized whereas little is known about receptors regulating cytokine production . Here we report that CD72 , which is considered to be an important co-receptor regulating B-cell activation , is also expressed on mouse NK cells . NK cells expressing high levels of CD72 , upon stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18 or target cells , produce significantly less IFN-gamma than those expressing low levels of CD72 , whereas both subsets are equally cytotoxic . Ectopic expression of CD72 in the murine NK-cell line KY2 inhibits cytokine-induced IFN-gamma production , and the inhibitory effect is diminished by mutations in the inhibitory motifs in the intracellular domain or replacement of the extracellular domain of CD72 . Thus , CD72 is an inhibitory receptor on NK cells regulating cytokine production .\\n'"

      "Test Document (69): «background the of hiv specific cell responses in people infected with locally circulating hiv strain will facilitate the development of hiv vaccine sixty intravenous drug users infected with hiv circulating recombinant form crf which has been spreading rapidly in western china from north to south were recruited from xinjiang china to assess the hiv specific cell responses at single peptide level with overlapping peptides olp covering the whole concensus clades and proteome results the median of the total magnitude and total number of olps recognized by ctl responses were sfc million pbmc and olps respectively when tested by clade peptides which was significantly higher than when tested by clade peptides the immunodominant regions which cover of the hiv proteome are widely distributed throughout the hiv proteome except in tat vpu and pol pr with gag pol rt pol int and nef being most frequently targeted the subdominant epitopes are mostly located in nef integrase vpr and vif of the responses directed to clade olps can be observed when tested with corresponding clade olps however pol pr and vpu tend to be targeted in the clade sequence rather than the clade sequence which is in line with the recombinant pattern of crf stronger and broader ctl responses in subjects with cd cell counts ranging from to mm were observed when compared to those with less than mm or more than mm though there have been no significant correlations identified between the accumulative ctl responses or overall breadth and cd cell count or plasma viral load conclusion this is the first study conducted to comprehensively address cell responses in chinese subjects infected with hiv crf in which subtle differences in cross reactivity were observed though similar patterns of overall immune responses were demonstrated with clade infected populations the immunodominant regions identified in this population can facilitate future hiv vaccine development in china»\n",
