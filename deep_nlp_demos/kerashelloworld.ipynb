    "A few months ago, I started a new job doing applied research at Fast Forward Labs. My new colleagues had just finished a project on image recongition with convolutional neural networks, and were starting on a new project on text summarization with recurrent neural networks. Neural networks were not something I'd previously worked with, so I knew I'd have to get up to speed fast.\n",

    "Despite all the recent excitement around deep learning, neural networks have a somewhat deserved reputation among non-specialists, who view them as computationally intensive to train and apply, difficult to interpret, and tedious to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was certainly my feeling. And while interpretability remains an issue, and you're going to want access to some pretty serious hardware to train and deploy large networks, the process of building and experimenting with neural networks has gotten a lot easier recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's because there are now _high-level_ neural network libraries that enable developers to quickly build neural network models without worrying about the numerical details of floating point operations, tensor algebra and GPU programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to look at one of these libraries, Keras. Keras is a high-level neural network library that, among many other things, wraps an API similar to scikit-learn's around the Theano or TensorFlow backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of that similarity with scikit-learn, and to emphasise that neural network design and testing is now accessible to everyone, I'm going to give you a quick tutorial on how to use Keras by explicitly comparing it to scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn is the most popular, feature-complete classical machine learning library used by Python developers. Among the many great things about Scikit-learn, my favourite is its simple, coherent and consistent API, which is built around `Estimator` objects. The API is a good description of machine learning workflow with which many engineers are already comfortable with, and it's consistently applied throughout the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started by importing the libraries we'll need: scikit-learn, Keras and some plotting features."
